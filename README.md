# Project Kendal

Kendal framework is a tool that aims at facilitating Java programmers work. It does it by allowing a programmer
to create some boilerplate pieces of code with a very little effort in an automatic manner. There is a set of
annotations defined by the library. Each of them allows for creation or modification of a code. Whenever programmer
decides he or she needs one of the functionalities supplied with a framework, one can use annotation instead of
manual creation of required code. Later, during project compilation, all the code is created/modified automatically
according to instructions specified by a programmer with all the annotations that he or she used. 

This project is a part of a Bachelor's diploma thesis in the field of Computer Science.
